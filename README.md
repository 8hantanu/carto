# carto

**A community-driven map application to guide those affected during disasters.**

Carto will be a map application to help people navigate during the times of a disaster. This app will act as a platform for the community consisting of people who can help or need help.

The users can help each other by doing the following. The app users can:

- point out places to avoid (flooded areas, blocked roads etc)
- mark safe havens and campsites
- share geo-coordinates when in need

Other features will include:

- navigation using the safest routes based on community's input
- latest updates of the incidents based on location

The app will be made on the Android platform and the map data will be saved in the Azure database.
